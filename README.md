# Compiler Project

This is a compiler project developed as part of the Compiler Construction course at **Universidad de Guadalajara**. The project is divided into three main stages: Lexical Analyzer, Syntax Analyzer, and Semantic Analyzer. It is implemented in C# using the .NET 6.0 framework.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a compiler for educational purposes, covering the essential components of a compiler, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis. Each stage of the compiler is implemented sequentially, with each stage building upon the previous one.

## Lexical Analyzer

- **Description:** The Lexical Analyzer is responsible for scanning the source code and converting it into a stream of tokens. It identifies keywords, operators, identifiers, and other language constructs.

## Syntax Analyzer

- **Description:** The Syntax Analyzer takes the stream of tokens generated by the Lexical Analyzer and checks whether the source code adheres to the specified grammar rules. It builds a syntax tree for the input program.

## Semantic Analyzer

- **Description:** The Semantic Analyzer performs semantic checks on the syntax tree to ensure that the program follows the language's semantics. It also generates intermediate code or performs other semantic tasks as required.
